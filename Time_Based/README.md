All time-based TLS currently assume cars are going 30 mph 

# 3-way (T and Y intersections)

Total cycle time = 120. 

Yellow light phase = 3 seconds.

Vehicle priorities: allows 10 OR 20 seconds before yellow light for cars only in T-intersection, 10 seconds for Y. 

Pedestrian priorities: allows for 10 OR 20 second LPI for T-intersection, 10 seconds for Y.

# 4-ways (crossroads and X-intersection)

Total cycle time = 4 * speed limit in mph, so 120 seconds.

Yellow light phase = 1 second for every 10 mph of the speed limit, so 3 seconds.

Vehicle priorities: allows ~10 seconds before yellow light where pedestrians are not allowed to walk. 

Pedestrian priorities: allows for ~10 second leading pedestrian interval (LPI) that gives pedestrians the opportunity to enter the crosswalk at an intersection before vehicles are given a green indication (currently allows cars to go straight, as it does not interfere with pedestrian path)

# 5-way

Total cycle time = 120 seconds.

Yellow light phase = 3 seconds.

Vehicle priorities: allows 10 seconds before yellow light for cars only. 

Pedestrian priorities: allows for 10 second LPI.
