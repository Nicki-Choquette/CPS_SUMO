# CPS_SUMO

Can download SUMO from here: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php
I downloaded the "sumo-win64-1.19.0"
It comes with Netedit (this is what is used to edit the network)

If you click on the "Set Traffic Light Mode" button in Netedit, then on the junction you want to edit
traffic lights for, you might be able to edit the TLS right in Netedit (see "TLS_in_Netedit.png"). 
Otherwise, you might just need to type the TLS file from scratch. Just google "sumo tls" or 
something similar, you'll find the same documentation I've been using.

One thing of note is that in some of the images in the documentation of sumo/netedit is that
I think the images are from an older version -- the current version seems to have a lot more
capabilities so that the files don't have to be typed from scratch. Do with that what you will.

Please don't alter any of the "Base_Network_Files". For each of the rule models you can create
a new folder and put the corresponding files in there. Thanks!
